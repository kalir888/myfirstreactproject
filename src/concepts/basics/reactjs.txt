What is React?

.it is a open source library for building user interfaces
.it is not a framework
.it focus more on UI rather than other things like routing, http

Techinical advantages of React:

.it is a component based architecture
.these components makes it possible to reuse the code
.React is declarative(like we are telling the house design to an engineer and engineer himself will draw the design)
.React will handle efficiently updating and rendering of the components only which need the change 
rather than updating the whole page
.DOM updates handle gracefully in React.


React runtime explanation:
        normally when designing a website through HTML we will dierectly in conversation with browser. But when we 
designing a website in ReactJS react will act as a middleman between programmer and UserInterface.

DOM: it is stands for Document object Model. The Document Object Model is a cross-platform and language-independent 
interface that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part 
of the document. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree.

HTML_Object: in react every HTML element considered as an Javascript Object

How react is running??
 
        in react it will create a virtual DOM and actual DOM. actual DOM will be executed in browser and the same replica
of the actual DOM which is virtual DOM will be stored in react itself. 

        now if any action done on UserInterface the react in response will create a new virtual DOM according to the action
done on the UI. now the react will compare the old virtual DOM which it is already stored before the action done and 
the new virtual DOM and it will return the list of changes to the browser and the browser will execute the changes in UI.
