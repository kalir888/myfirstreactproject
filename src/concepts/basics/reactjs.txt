What is React?

.it is a open source library for building user interfaces
.it is not a framework
.it focus more on UI rather than other things like routing, http

Techinical advantages of React:

.it is a component based architecture
.these components makes it possible to reuse the code
.React is declarative(like we are telling the house design to an engineer and engineer himself will draw the design)
.React will handle efficiently updating and rendering of the components only which need the change 
rather than updating the whole page
.DOM updates handle gracefully in React.
