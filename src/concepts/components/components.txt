in react the component represents a part of the UI. they are reusable .In react all the components are contained by a main component 
which is Root(App). other all the components will be nested components.

Component in code:
    A component code will be placed in a Javascript file(like App.js). in react we have two types of component
    they are
            1. Stateless Functional Component
            2. Stateful Class Component
Stateless Functional Component: Functional Components are literally Javascript functions they will return the HTML components
that describes the UI.

Stateful Class Component: Class Components are regulare ES6 Classes that extend the Component class from the react library
it must have a render method which will return the HTML component that describes the UI.
