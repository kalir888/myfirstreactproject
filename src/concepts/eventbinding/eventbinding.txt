already the program realted to this event binding is done by me in classbasedcomponents

there are three weay to bind the event 
    1. declare the event as a arrow function inside the onclick event
    2. binding the event while declaring itself
    3. binding the event in constructor(is the best option)
    4. declare the event as a arrow function in the class
