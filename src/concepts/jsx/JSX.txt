JSX stands for Javascript XML. it is a extension to the Javascript language syntax. with React library it is an extension
to write HTML, XML like codes for elements and components.

JSX tags have a tag name, attributes and children. JSX is not a necessity to write React applications. JSX makes your
react code simpler and elegant. JSX ultimately transpiles to pure Javascript which is understood by the browsers.

Each JSX element is Syntactic sugar for the React.component element.

    2. for -> htmlFor
