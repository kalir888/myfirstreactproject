if we want to change the state of class we must use setstate method. otherwise the changes will be done but it 
will not be rendered in UI.

Always make use of setState and never modify the state dierectly

if a code has to be executed after the state has been updated? use the call back function which is second argument to the 
setState method.

when you have to update state based on the previous state value , pass in a function as an argument instead of the
regular object.
