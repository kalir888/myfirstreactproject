the state hook allow us to use state in functional components.

Rules:
    only call hooks at the top level. dont call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
    only call hooks from react functions. call them from within React functional components and not just any regular
    javascript function 


Advantages: 

The useState hook lets you add state to functional components
in classes, the state is always an object
with the useState hook, the state doesn't have to be an object.
the useState hook returns an array with 2 elements
the first element is the current value of the state, and the second element is a state setter function.
